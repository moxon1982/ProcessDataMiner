# ProcessDataMiner
Program to look for a certain process on a windows OS and read out its memory to get information about that process. I am developing on Windows 10 with 64 bit architecture so I am not garanteeing that the code will run on anything else than this OS.

This program is going to be written in C++ with the QT 5.8 framework. I came up with the idea to write that kind of software while
I was playing the ancient game "Patrizier 2 Gold Edition". While I was developing in that game I mentioned that the information you
can get from the game itself is pretty poor.

As I was trying to improve my skills in C++ anyway I thought I could rather try to read out that games memory to collect 
information about all the cities and their needs and put them on a dashboard. So while I was trying to figure out how the hell I 
can read out the memory of windows processes, I was using different computers using USB-sticks to transfer my source codes, GitHub
came in handy.

So now I am here creating my very first repository on github for this project so I don't necessarily have to use USB-sticks again 
to transfer my code but instead use the QT Designer built in git support.

List of what tools I am using:
* QT 5.8 Framework
** https://www.qt.io/download/
* Visual C++ 2015 Build Tools
** http://landinghub.visualstudio.com/visual-cpp-build-tools

As the QT Framework is free to use as long as you follow the GPLv3 I am giving this information so you don't have to dig for
information about how to get this code running.
